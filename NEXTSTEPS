Additional Notes:

    Secrets Management:
        Ensure you have the following secrets set in your GitHub repository:
            DOCKERHUB_USERNAME
            DOCKERHUB_TOKEN (a DockerHub Access Token)
            AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
            AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
    Docker Image Tagging:
        The Docker image is tagged with latest. For better version control, consider using commit SHA or version numbers.
    Error Handling:
        continue-on-error: true is set for the Job wait step to allow the workflow to proceed even if the Job fails.
    Log Retrieval:
        The logs from the pod are retrieved to help you verify the script's output.
    Cleanup:
        Deleting the Job ensures that no resources are left running after the workflow completes.

By making these updates, your workflow will now:

    Include your du.py script in a Docker image.
    Build and push this image to DockerHub.
    Deploy a Kubernetes Job to your EKS cluster that runs the script.
    Wait for the Job to complete and retrieve logs.
    Clean up resources after execution.

Feel free to ask if you need further assistance or clarification on any of these steps!
